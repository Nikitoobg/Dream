## Variables
### Variable Declaration
- To declare a variable you have to write:
```
thing varName;
```
> [!TIP]
> It will be better to write `thing varName = 14;` because you declare the variable and determine its value on the same line.
- To declare a constant variable you have to write:
```
unchangeable varName = 14;
```
> [!IMPORTANT]
> When you register a constanstant variable you always have to determine its value.

> [!NOTE]
> You <ins>ALWAYS</ins> have to end a variable declaration with a semicolon!

 
### Assigning a variable a new value
- To assign a variable a new value you simply have to write:
```
varName = 14;
```
 <!-- See in the code does it end with a semicilon -->
